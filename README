cl-cffi-glib is a Lisp binding of parts of the GLib, GObject and GIO libraries
needed to implement a Lisp binding for the GTK 3 and GTK 4 libraries. This
library is loaded from the cl-cffi-gtk3 library for a Lisp binding to GTK 3,
cl-cffi-gtk4 library for a Lisp binding to GTK 4, and cl-cffi-pango for the
Lisp binding to Pango.

GLib is a general-purpose utility library, which provides useful data types,
macros, type conversions, string utilities, file utilities, a mainloop
abstraction, and so on. GOBJECT provides the base type system and object class.
Gio is a library providing classes for general purpose I/O, networking, IPC,
settings, and other high level application functionality.

cl-cffi-glib is licensed using the LGPL, which has been adopted with a preamble
that clarifies the terms for use with Lisp programs and is referred as the
LLGPL.

This work is based on the cl-gtk2 library developed by Kalyanov Dmitry. The
cl-cffi-glib library was part of the cl-cffi-gtk library and was separated
out to be used independently. The former cl-cffi-gtk library is replaced with
the cl-cffi-gtk3 and cl-cffi-gtk4 libraries for GTK 3 and GTK 4, respectivly.
